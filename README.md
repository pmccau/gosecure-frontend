# Overview

This is the frontend portion that goes with the gosecure backend. It's meant to run on a 7" Raspberry Pi-compatible screen, so sizing and layout may be off if run elsewhere. If it uses gosecure, why is it called pysecure? For a moment it was using a Flask backend, and has yet to be renamed...
